This application was developed based on the guided project in Microsoft Learning Path Create and manage model-driven apps with power Apps and Dataverse, with additional features added to enhance the application.  
The app streamlines the management of commercial and residential real estate properties and client interactions of a fictional company named Contoso Real Estate, which keeps track of property listings.

## Architecture and Data Model

### Tables

   - Columns: Property Name (Text), Asking Price (Number), Street (Text), City (Text), Bedrooms (Lookup), Bathrooms (Lookup), Sold (Yes/No).
   - Relationships: Related to Showings table.

2. **Showings**: 
   - Columns: Name (Text), Showing Date (Date), Shown to (Lookup to Contact), Shown by (Lookup to User), Property Shown (Lookup to Real Estate Property), Comments (Text), Level of Interest (Lookup).

3. **Contacts**: Pre-existing table for customer information.

### Relationships

- **One-to-Many**:

    - Real Estate Properties to Showings: Each property can have multiple showings.
    - Accounts to Contacts: Each account can have multiple associated contacts.
